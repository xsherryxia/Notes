The heart of the problem: (Chris)
Once a earthquake happens, another will happen in the future. The alarm prediction model is that when an earthquake 
happens we put on an alarm. Its not a poisson process. There is memory to it. When there is an earthquake above a 
certain magnitude, set alarm, set alert and it might go over. A wast of resources.  Alarm window.
Put alert after a certain earthquake….if have it on for a long time, then will include more earthquake. Longer, higher 
cost. You limit window and have it on only for a certain amount of time. Two parameters: T (cost) amt of time you are 
looking at.
How often is the alarm on, what percentages of my window is the alarm on. How big is an alert, cost of your strategy…
alert time and size.
Nu: how many incidents you miss because of the strategy.
We want to optimize the curve of Nu vs. Tau
How many earthquakes you miss over how many earthquakes happen. 
Different types of strategies.
One is W(M) depends on magnitude. = k*nu
Exponential amount of time for alarm if bigger earthquake (bigger magnitude)
Training data to get K and U. You get an earthquake. 
ETAS is more complicated….
Window size vs. magnitude, slightly different formula to beat the ETAS model.
Take data and if I did have the function here, what would the points be for the optimal case. Best I can do given the size and magnitude of the earthquakes.
Can you plot the optimal curve, how long the window should be on, can the curve be better the simple alarm model….
Simulate the W(M)=ku model….how good it does for metrics…..


Project 3 assignment Instructions:
Work to solve one of the problems. Show how this was solved or addressed in the group and how it integrates to the 
whole project. 
As long as every group has a presenter that is fine….
