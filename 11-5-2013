Presentation Notes:
11/5/2013
Presentation was recorded…
Import curate_util as CU
Catalog = CU…
Convert ‘MAG’ to float
Curators also crated the ppx which the analyzers requested. 
Outputs date range for visualizer for the earthquakes….
Look at certain packages and figure out how to use them…
Look at Luen’s visualizations.

$
Histogram of permutation test
Graphic of magnitude of earthquakes
CDF of ETAS model gamma nu and empirical models…
Error diagram

#
Skeleton code for accessing the dataframe…

Q
Understanding ETAS
Can access the presentation here: Bit.ly/….
ETAS presumes that seismicity follows the Poisson process
Ripal effects fits the omori law
ETAS library in R. Modeling the aftershocks.
Etas()
Calculate the conditional intensity, turn on alarm, ….
Helps us find T and v….

Heart group
Compare and contrast different models…

Big picture: 
Curators as communicators and checkers at the end of the process since curators might finish early. USGIS code….
ETAS R package form
Weekly meetings for presenters. To update each other…
Look at the background issue and respond. Names issues. Figure out who is in what group.

Aaron’s feedback:
See if reflections are addressed….
Etas package not so useful. Another package might be better.
Comparing ETAS v. MDA 
We need to decide the magnitude range (lower and upper bound) , geospatial boundaries, 
We need to decide which ETAS model to use: Comparing against a strongest version of the ETAS model.
Three different packages that would suffice for what we are doing.
ETAS/SAPP/PtProcess (leaning towards SAPP)
What data are we going to compare….
This is posted as an issue.
How do we check those assumptions? Invite Luen on the 12th, also Richard Allan, data lab, etc.




Notes for our group:

Roadblocks:
•	ppx is not helpful
•	Divide curators and assign to check other groups’ work.
•	Communication with the other curator group.
o	 bit.ly/stat157_notes
•	Set to use SAPP package instead: still okay, CSV.
